Instagram talk now.

Redis db

Async background broker

"Justin Bieber problem"

(Didn't say how their broker was built -- MQ like?)

Oh. They're using Gearman.

 - Simple purpose built task queue
 - Weak Framework Support

 * They ran out of memory and crashed, no recovery
 * "Probably should have used Redis at this point"

Now enters Celery (yay)

 - celeryd
 - excellent django support

Which broker?

Redis
+ Already use it
+ Very Fast, Efficient
- Polling for Task Distribution
- Messy Non-Synchronous Replication
- Memory Limits Task Capacity

Beanstalk
+ Purpose-Built Task Queue
+ Very Fast, Efficient
+ Pushes to Consumers
+ Spills to Disk
- No Replication
- Useless For Anything Else

RabbitMQ (ha, that's what I plan to use)
+ Reasonably Fast, Efficient
+ Spill-To-Disk
+ Low-Maintenance Synchronous Replication
+ Excellent Celery Compatibility
+ Support

RabbitMQ 3.0

EC2 c1.xlarge, RAID instance storage
- "Way Overprovisioned"

Alerting

We use Sensu
Monitors & alerts on queue length threshold
... rabbitmctl

# Missed writing this section

Round robin approach to select a broker

~25,000 app threads, publishing tasks

Span datacenters

Celery only supported 1 broker host last year when we started
Created kombu-multibroker "shim"
Multiple brokers used in ...

Concurrency Models
+ multiproc
- eventlet
+ gevent
- threads

"gevent is cool and all but..."

*Separate slow and fast tasks*

# At a hack level, but a reasonable design choice

"NLP Proof gives us choices -- to retry or not to retry"

*Publisher confirms*
* AMQP default is that we don't know if things were published or not
* Publisher Confirms makes broker send acks back on publishes
* kombu-multibroker forces this
* Can cause dup...

"Avoid using async tasks as a 'backup' mechanism only during failures. It'll probably break."

They avoided pickling things and went with super simple object passing...

# Why not protobufs, thrift, json, avro, etc.?

Summary
~~~~~~~

Celery + RabbitMQ
Kombu

Actions for me
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Build rabbit-in-a-box
* Try out celery

Now at Asheesh Laroia's "Scrapy it GETs the web"

Loved his statement "CSS gives you an API incidentally built by web designers"

scrapyd is a daemon you can throw scrapy projects at. I'll try that out later.

Better disable the telnet console

Async kitty

import spidermonkey
# Firefox's javascript runtime

Use selenium

Scrapy -> Django :)

Onto the Sphinx automation talk.

First up, reStructuredText is awesome.

"Issue roles for simplicity" -- makes you tied to the design of your text, but gives you programmability and agility
