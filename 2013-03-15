@ Instagram talk now.

Redis media id

Async background -- broker

"Justin Bieber problem"

(Didn't say how their broker was built -- MQ like)

Oh. They're using Gearman.
 - Simple purpose built task queue
 - Weak Framework Support

 - They ran out of memory and crashed, no recovery

 - "Probably should have used Redis at this point"

Now enters Celery (yay)
 - celeryd
 - excellent django support

 Which broker?

Redis
+ Already use it
+ Very Fast, Efficient
- Polling for Task Distribution
- Messy Non-Synchronous Replication
- Memory Limits Task Capacity

Beanstalk
+ Purpose-Built Task Queue
+ Very Fast, Efficient
+ Pushes to Consumers
+ Spills to Disk
- No Replication
- Useless For Anything Else

RabbitMQ (ha, that's what I plan to use)
+ Reasonably Fast, Efficient
+ Spill-To-Disk
+ Low-Maintenance Synchronous Replication
+ Excellent Celery Compatibility
+ Support
-


RabbitMQ 3.0

EC2 c1.xlarge, RAID instance storage
- "Way Overprovisioned"

Alerting
We use Sensu
Monitors & alerts on quue lenght threshold
... rabbitmctl


Graphing
========
...

Round robin approach to select a broker

~25,000 app threads, publishing tasks

Span datacenters

Celery only supported 1 broker host last year when we started
Created kombu-multibroker "shim"
Multiple brokers used in ...


Concurrency Models
+ multiproc
- eventlet
+ gevent
- threads


"gevent is cool and all but..."

*Separate slow and fast tasks*
# At a hack level, but a reasonable design choice
















Summary
=======

Celery + RabbitMQ
