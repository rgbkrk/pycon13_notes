============================

Yesterday I (lightly) participated in the sprints, spending some time getting django-deployer working with dotcloud (neither of which have I used before). Django-deployer tries to make deployments of django applications to multiple PaaS providers as easy as a few commands with a configuration file.

It's really too bad the PaaS providers don't have an interface that is common enough to all that configuration amongst all of them would be easy. Each has their own special sauce (Heroku for example puts STATIC_ROOT and MEDIA_ROOT stuffs in S3).

I also contributed some quick little changes to python-guide (grammar, spelling). I spent more time reading than editing. ;)

This morning I'm geared up and ready to go to PyData.

Keynote of the morning was *the* Peter Norvig, the Director of Research at Google. His talk was titled "Learning Python".

He wrote "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach"

Originally, all the code examples were lisp. He wanted to add something closer to pseudo-code. I think you can guess the final choice...

Benjamin Bloom's paper

"The average under tutoring [with mastery learning] was about 2 standard deviations above the average of the control." - Benjamin Bloom, 1984

2 minutes of AI learning

Massive classes

Analyzing Intro CS MOOC Data 101

His big idea:
We should do for syntax errors what Google does for search queries.

.. code:
       if x = 1:
            ^
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Should instead say:

.. code:
       if x = 1:
            ^
   SyntaxError: use == to check equality, = for assignment

# Premature optimization: code blocking I/O

He wrote a chaining class that forces functions that don't return the called object to return the object that called it... Hrmmm...

Why do students stay or go?

Motivation, not information

bus route -- cohort of students starting today
If something comes up, you can get off the bus and then hop back on that bus stop again.

Express bus, local bus.

Untrain the "if I put something wrong into the computer, the computer will error"
# This theme comes up all the freaking time with computer science. We need a cultural change.

Transcripts are low bandwidth information on


I wonder if there are any large pseudo-anonymized data stores of (post-graduation) transcript grades

One-on-one tutoring, machine learning
large scale courseware engineering
social; motivation
machine learning, continual improvement

Data, privacy, and anonymization are recurring themes. How does one generate datasets we can reliably let others use without damning the individuals the data came from? It seems like there really isn't a way without losing a lot of the features that matter. People will always find ways to creatively point back to a user with enough aggregate information.
