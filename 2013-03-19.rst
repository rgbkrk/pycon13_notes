============================

Yesterday I (lightly) participated in the sprints, spending some time getting django-deployer working with dotcloud (neither of which have I used before). Django-deployer tries to make deployments of django applications to multiple PaaS providers as easy as a few commands with a configuration file.

It's really too bad the PaaS providers don't have an interface that is common enough to all that configuration amongst all of them would be easy. Each has their own special sauce (Heroku for example puts STATIC_ROOT and MEDIA_ROOT stuffs in S3).

I also contributed some quick little changes to python-guide (grammar, spelling). I spent more time reading than editing. ;)

This morning I'm geared up and ready to go to PyData.

============================
Keynote of the morning was *the* Peter Norvig, the Director of Research at Google. His talk was titled "Learning Python".

He wrote "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach"

Originally, all the code examples were lisp. He wanted to add something closer to pseudo-code. I think you can guess the final choice...

Benjamin Bloom's paper

"The average under tutoring [with mastery learning] was about 2 standard deviations above the average of the control." - Benjamin Bloom, 1984

2 minutes of AI learning

Massive classes

Analyzing Intro CS MOOC Data 101

His big idea:
We should do for syntax errors what Google does for search queries.

.. code:
       if x = 1:
            ^
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Should instead say:

.. code:
       if x = 1:
            ^
   SyntaxError: use == to check equality, = for assignment


Attractive Nuisance

# Premature optimization: code blocking I/O

He wrote a chaining class that forces functions that don't return the called object to return the object that called it... Hrmmm...

Why do students stay or go?

Motivation, not information

Peer support (forums, outside groups)
Faculty encouragement (email)
Pride of accomplishment

synchronous, evergreen, semi-synchronous, bus route

bus route -- cohort of students starting today
If something comes up, you can get off the bus and then hop back on that bus stop again.

Express bus, local bus.

Untrain the "if I put something wrong into the computer, the computer will error"
# This theme comes up all the freaking time with computer science. We need a cultural change.

TDD for teaching


Do we trust bloom?


Many types of Individualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Student control over rewind (multiplay)
Student choice over ...

Students shouldn't feel restricted from performing on the computer.

Transcripts are low bandwidth information on


I wonder if there are any large pseudo-anonymized data stores of (post-graduation) transcript grades

One-on-one tutoring, machine learning
large scale courseware engineering
social; motivation
machine learning, continual improvement

Data, privacy, and anonymization are recurring themes. How does one generate datasets we can reliably let others use without damning the individuals the data came from? It seems like there really isn't a way without losing a lot of the features that matter. People will always find ways to creatively point back to a user with enough aggregate information.

Time for "Python in an evolving enterprise system"

Ad bidding in milliseconds

AppNexus has really evolved in the last few years.


Data-Driven Decisioning team


"Python enables us to scale our team and rapidly iterate and prototype technologies"


AppNexus sounds pretty awesome.

They built up a huge Hadoop cluster.

1PB Cluster
862 Nodes

I want these slides.

Definitely looking forward to all these talks going online.

Big Data: TBs/Hr
Medium Data: GBs/Hr


"*To enable the next generation* of data modeling, we need to leverage the Hadoop cluster"

Access the data on Hadoop

The budget problem
We have thousands of bidders buying billions of ads per hour in real time auctions.

We need to create a model that can manipulate how our bidders spend their budgets and purchase ads.

Someone is wearing a fragrance that is *hurting my nose and giving me a headache*. I'm going to steer clear of them throughout the conference.
