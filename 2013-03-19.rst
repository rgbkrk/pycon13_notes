============================

Yesterday I (lightly) participated in the sprints, spending some time getting django-deployer working with dotcloud (neither of which have I used before). Django-deployer tries to make deployments of django applications to multiple PaaS providers as easy as a few commands with a configuration file.

It's really too bad the PaaS providers don't have an interface that is common enough to all that configuration amongst all of them would be easy. Each has their own special sauce (Heroku for example puts STATIC_ROOT and MEDIA_ROOT stuffs in S3).

I also contributed some quick little changes to python-guide (grammar, spelling). I spent more time reading than editing. ;)

This morning I'm geared up and ready to go to PyData.
