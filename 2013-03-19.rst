============================

Yesterday I (lightly) participated in the sprints, spending some time getting django-deployer working with dotcloud (neither of which have I used before). Django-deployer tries to make deployments of django applications to multiple PaaS providers as easy as a few commands with a configuration file.

It's really too bad the PaaS providers don't have an interface that is common enough to all that configuration amongst all of them would be easy. Each has their own special sauce (Heroku for example puts STATIC_ROOT and MEDIA_ROOT stuffs in S3).

I also contributed some quick little changes to python-guide (grammar, spelling). I spent more time reading than editing. ;)

This morning I'm geared up and ready to go to PyData.

Keynote of the morning was *the* Peter Norvig, the Director of Research at Google. His talk was titled "Learning Python".

He wrote "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach"

Originally, all the code examples were lisp. He wanted to add something closer to pseudo-code. I think you can guess the final choice...

Analyzing Intro CS MOOC Data 101

His big idea:
We should do for syntax errors what Google does for search queries.

.. code:
       if x = 1:
            ^
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Should instead say:

.. code:
       if x = 1:
            ^
   SyntaxError: use == to check equality, = for assignment

# Premature optimization: code blocking I/O

He wrote a chaining class that forces functions that don't return the called object to return the object that called it... Hrmmm...

If something comes up, you can get off the bus and then hop back on that bus stop again.

# This theme comes up all the freaking time with computer science. We need a cultural change.
