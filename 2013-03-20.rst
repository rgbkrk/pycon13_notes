Last day.

Keynote on IPython

Beyond (floating point) number crunching

The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.

The computer as a microscope
Exploratory: Problem's definition evolves as we understand it
No 'requirements' to build an application against
Mathematica, Maple, Matlab, IDL, etc.
 - All have an interactive environment

   Applications        Languages
  (Tie Fighter)         (Legos)

The lifecycle of a scientific idea (schematically)
1. Individual exploratory work
2. Collaborative development
3. Parallel production runs (HPC, cloud, ...)
4. Publication (with reproducible results!)
5. Education
6. Goto 1.
